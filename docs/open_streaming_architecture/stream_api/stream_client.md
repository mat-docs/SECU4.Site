# Stream API Client
C# libraries for the Stream API, generated from the proto files, are available to facilitate testing and deployment. 

[`MA.Streaming.Proto.Client.Local`](https://github.com/orgs/mat-docs/packages/nuget/package/MA.Streaming.Proto.Client.Local) 
can be used in conjunction with 
[`MA.Streaming.Proto.ServerComponent`](stream_server.md#stream-api-local-server)

[`MA.Streaming.Proto.Client.Remote`](https://github.com/orgs/mat-docs/packages/nuget/package/MA.Streaming.Proto.Client.Remote) 
can be used in conjunction with the [Stream API Server Container](stream_server.md#stream-api-remote-server-container).

These libraries can be found at NuGet packages on the [McLaren Applied NuGet feed](https://github.com/orgs/mat-docs/packages). 

Given the API is created under the gRPC framework, it is possible to generate client and server classes in a language of
your choice. 

For details of each of the RPC calls, refer to the [protocol documentation](../docs.md).
